# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for detecting spam messages using machine learning. The notebook is based on a CSV dataset of SMS messages, which includes labels indicating whether each message is spam or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which consists of 5,572 SMS messages in English, tagged according to being ham (legitimate) or spam. The dataset is available in the `data` subdirectory of this repository as a CSV file named `spam.csv`.

## Notebook

The notebook is implemented using Python, and uses the scikit-learn library for performing machine learning tasks. It is hosted on Google Colab, and can be accessed through the following link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JIjaKCv_dUGemBYpE5H2OFgzxFjTN8hw?usp=sharing
